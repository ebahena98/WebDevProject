also border in an element's total width and height.

Display Property (LINK: https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_class_display.php)
The display property specifies the display behavior (the type of rendering box) of an element.

Justify Content Property (LINK: https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/playdemo.php?filename=playcss_justify-content ; https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_justify-content.php)
The justify-content property aligns the flexible container's items when the items do not use all available space on the main-axis (horizontally)

Align Items Property (LINK: https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_align-items.php ; https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/playdemo.php?filename=playcss_align-items)
The align-items property specifies the default alignment for items inside a flexbox or grid container.
In a flexbox container, the flexbox items are aligned on the cross axis, which is vertical by default (opposite of flex-direction).
In a grid container, the grid items are aligned in the block direction. For pages in English, block direction is downward and inline direction is left to right.

Background Property (LINK: https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_background.php ; https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/playdemo.php?filename=playcss_background)
The background property is a shorthand property for:
background-color
background-image
background-position
background-size
background-repeat
background-origin
background-clip
background-attachment
It does not matter if one of the values above are missing, e.g. background:#ff0000 url(smiley.gif); is allowed.

- HTML DOM Document querySelector() (LINK: https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_document_queryselector.asp)
- The querySelector() method returns the first element that matches a CSS selector.
- To return all matches (not only the first), use the querySelectorAll() instead.
- Both querySelector() and querySelectorAll() throw a SYNTAX_ERR exception if the selector(s) is invalid.
